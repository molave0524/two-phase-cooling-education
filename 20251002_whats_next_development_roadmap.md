## Recommended Next Steps (Prioritized)

### 1. Order System Enhancement - HIGHEST PRIORITY

**Why this is important:**

- Critical for customer service and order tracking
- Customers need SKU in their order confirmations
- Required for fulfillment and shipping
- Builds on existing checkout flow

**What needs to be done:**

- Add SKU to order confirmation page
- Include SKU in order confirmation emails
- Display SKU in order history/details
- Add SKU to admin order management views
- Include SKU in packing slips/invoices

**Files to modify:**

- src/app/checkout/success/page.tsx (order confirmation)
- Email templates (if they exist)
- src/app/orders/[id]/page.tsx (order details)
- Order-related API routes

**Technical notes:**

- Order items already store productId and productName
- Need to add productSku field to order_items table
- Should capture SKU at time of order (in case it changes later)
- May need database migration for order_items table

---

### 2. Product Management Admin Interface

**Why this is important:**

- Allows you to manage products without touching the database directly
- Can edit SKU, pricing, inventory, descriptions, etc.
- Reduces risk of errors from manual database updates
- Enables non-technical team members to manage products

**What needs to be done:**

- Create admin dashboard at /admin or /dashboard
- Add authentication/authorization for admin access
- Build product CRUD interface:
  - List all products
  - Edit product details (including SKU)
  - Add new products
  - Delete/archive products
  - Manage inventory levels
  - Upload/manage product images

**Files to create:**

- src/app/admin/page.tsx (admin dashboard)
- src/app/admin/products/page.tsx (product list)
- src/app/admin/products/[id]/edit/page.tsx (edit product)
- src/app/admin/products/new/page.tsx (create product)
- src/app/api/admin/products/route.ts (API endpoints)

**Technical notes:**

- Need admin role/permission system
- Should use NextAuth.js for authentication (already implemented)
- Consider using React Hook Form for forms
- Need file upload for product images
- Should validate SKU uniqueness
- Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

---

### 3. Inventory Tracking System

**Why this is important:**

- Prevents overselling
- Tracks stock levels by SKU
- Enables low-stock alerts
- Automatic stock updates when orders are placed

**What needs to be done:**

- Enhance stockQuantity tracking
- Add inventory history/audit log
- Create low-stock alerts
- Build inventory dashboard
- Add bulk inventory updates
- Track inventory movements (sales, restocks, adjustments)

**Database changes needed:**

- Add inventory_history table to track changes
- Fields: id, product_id, sku, quantity_change, reason, timestamp, user_id
- Add inventory alert thresholds to products table

**Files to create:**

- src/app/admin/inventory/page.tsx
- src/app/api/admin/inventory/route.ts
- src/lib/inventory.ts (inventory management logic)

**Technical notes:**

- Stock should decrease when order is placed
- Consider reserved stock for pending orders
- Need transaction support to prevent race conditions
- Should send alerts when stock falls below threshold
- Track who made inventory adjustments

---

### 4. Analytics Dashboard

**Why this is important:**

- Understand which products are selling
- Track revenue by SKU
- Make data-driven business decisions
- Identify trends and patterns

**What needs to be done:**

- Build analytics dashboard
- Track metrics:
  - Sales by SKU
  - Revenue by product
  - Most viewed products
  - Conversion rates
  - Cart abandonment by product
  - Average order value
- Add date range filters
- Export reports to CSV
- Create visualizations (charts/graphs)

**Files to create:**

- src/app/admin/analytics/page.tsx
- src/app/api/admin/analytics/route.ts
- src/lib/analytics.ts

**Technical notes:**

- May want to use charting library (recharts, chart.js, etc.)
- Consider aggregating data for performance
- Add caching for expensive queries
- Track events client-side and server-side
- Consider using Google Analytics or Mixpanel integration

---

### 5. Export Features (Lower Priority)

**What needs to be done:**

- Export products to CSV with SKU
- Export orders to CSV with SKU
- Generate inventory reports
- Create printable packing slips

**Technical notes:**

- Use csv-writer or similar library
- Include all relevant fields
- Format properly for Excel compatibility
