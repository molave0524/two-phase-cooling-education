# Two-Phase Immersion Computer Cooling FAQ

## Using TMC-49 Dielectric Fluid

---

## **1. What is Two-Phase Immersion Cooling?**

Two-phase immersion cooling is an advanced thermal management technology where electronic components are completely submerged in a dielectric fluid that boils when heated. The fluid changes from liquid to vapor (phase change) at the heat source, removing heat through latent heat of vaporization, then condenses back to liquid in a condenser, creating a highly efficient cooling loop.

**Key Benefits:**

- 95% reduction in cooling energy costs compared to traditional air cooling
- Supports computing power of 120 kW and above per cabinet
- 10x less space required than conventional cooling infrastructure
- Eliminates risks of leaks or corrosion associated with water-based systems
