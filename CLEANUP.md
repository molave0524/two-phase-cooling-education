# Technical Debt Cleanup Plan

## Current Status: ✅ PRODUCTION READY
The site is fully functional with:
- ✅ Working navigation
- ✅ Distinct section backgrounds
- ✅ Framework foundation restored
- ✅ No broken functionality

## Remaining Technical Debt (Optional Cleanup)

### Phase 2: Replace Inline Styles with Tailwind Classes
**Priority: Medium | Impact: Code consistency**

**Files to update:**
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Replace `style={{}}` with Tailwind classes:
  ```jsx
  // Current: style={{ background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #e0f2fe, #bae6fd, #7dd3fc)' }}
  // Target: className="bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-100 to-blue-300"
  ```

**Sections to convert:**
- Hero section gradient
- Technology section background
- Demonstrations section background
- Performance section background
- AI Assistant section gradient
- Products section background
- Call to Action section gradient

### Phase 3: Remove Emergency CSS Overrides
**Priority: Low | Impact: Code cleanliness**

**Remove from `public/force-styles.css`:**
- [ ] Section background force styles (lines 9-77)
- [ ] Layout force styles (.flex, .grid overrides)
- [ ] Typography force overrides
- [ ] Eventually remove entire file when empty

**Test after each removal to ensure styling remains intact.**

### Framework Compliance Achieved ✅
- [x] Tailwind safelist configured
- [x] Custom utilities moved to proper Tailwind plugin
- [x] Build process fixed
- [x] Navigation emergency overrides removed

## Notes for Future Developers

**Why this technical debt exists:**
- Emergency fixes applied during CSS framework issues
- Site was broken, needed immediate solutions
- Used `!important` and direct CSS to bypass framework problems

**Safe cleanup approach:**
- Remove overrides incrementally
- Test after each change
- Prioritize user-facing functionality over code purity

**Framework practices now in place:**
- Use Tailwind safelist for dynamic classes
- Custom utilities defined in `tailwind.config.js`
- Proper PostCSS configuration
