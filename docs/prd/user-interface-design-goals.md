# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Create an immersive educational experience where visitors land directly into video demonstrations rather than traditional product marketing. The interface should feel like a high-tech laboratory or NASA mission control center, emphasizing the scientific and engineering excellence of two-phase cooling technology. Visual hierarchy guides users through progressive learning: from dramatic "circuits getting wet" introductory videos to deep technical understanding via AI assistant interactions.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Video-First Navigation**: Primary navigation through demonstration video selection and educational content discovery
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Educational content reveals complexity gradually, from basic thermal principles to advanced two-phase science
- **Conversational Learning**: AI assistant integration feels natural and immediate, not like a separate chat interface
- **Visual Data Integration**: Temperature monitoring, performance metrics seamlessly overlay video content without distraction
- **Mobile-First Responsive**: Touch-optimized controls for video interaction and AI assistant on mobile devices

## Core Screens and Views

- **Landing/Demo Hub**: Video demonstration showcase with immediate visual impact of two-phase cooling in action
- **Educational Library**: Organized thermal science content integrated with demonstration videos
- **AI Assistant Interface**: Contextual technical support overlaid or integrated with educational content
- **Comparison Gallery**: Side-by-side thermal imaging and performance comparisons with traditional cooling
- **Product Information**: Technical specifications and ordering information presented as natural progression from education
- **About Technology**: Deep-dive content explaining enterprise heritage, environmental benefits, and scientific principles

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

Ensure educational content is accessible to learners with disabilities through proper video captions, audio descriptions for visual demonstrations, keyboard navigation for all interactive elements, and screen reader compatibility for AI assistant interactions.

## Branding

Professional, scientific aesthetic emphasizing precision engineering and cutting-edge technology. Visual design should evoke high-tech laboratory environments with clean lines, technical diagrams, and sophisticated color palette. The transparent cooling case itself becomes a key visual brand element - "functional sculpture" that bridges performance and aesthetics. Avoid gaming-centric visual language in favor of professional engineering and scientific credibility.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Web-responsive design optimized for desktop viewing of detailed video demonstrations while maintaining full functionality on mobile devices. Prioritize desktop experience for complex educational content while ensuring mobile users can access core learning materials and AI assistant effectively.
