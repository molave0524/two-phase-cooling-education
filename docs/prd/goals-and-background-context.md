# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Create an educational platform that teaches two-phase cooling science through **high-quality pre-recorded demonstrations**
- Achieve $500K revenue within 12 months through education-driven conversion (3-5% vs industry 1-2%)
- Establish market authority as the definitive source for advanced cooling education in USA
- Build community of informed advocates who provide feedback and organic promotion
- Validate technology through credible YouTube tech channel reviews within first 3 months
- Demonstrate superiority over traditional cooling through **professional video demonstrations and FLIR thermal imaging**
- Provide instant technical answers via AI assistant to eliminate education barriers

## Background Context

The high-performance PC enthusiast market faces a critical knowledge gap in cooling technology selection. Traditional cooling solutions (air cooling, basic liquid cooling) increasingly fail to handle modern high-TDP components like I9-14900KS CPUs and RTX 4090 GPUs, yet advanced two-phase cooling remains mysterious "enterprise-only" technology. No platform exists to educate enthusiasts about thermal science principles or demonstrate advanced cooling through **comprehensive video demonstrations**.

This PRD addresses the market opportunity created by affordable two-phase cooling fluids with minimal GWP (equivalent to gasoline at 20) and zero ODP becoming available in the USA market. By creating an education-first platform featuring **professional pre-recorded demonstrations**, FLIR thermal imaging comparisons, and AI technical assistance, we transform how cooling technology is understood and adopted while building a sustainable competitive advantage through informed customer advocacy.

This approach ensures consistent, high-quality educational content that can be professionally produced to showcase the dramatic visual elements (liquid jets, "circuits getting wet," progressive thermal loads) with optimal cinematography and multiple camera angles.
