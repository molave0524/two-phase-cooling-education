# Two-Phase Cooling Education Center Website Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Create an educational platform that teaches two-phase cooling science through **high-quality pre-recorded demonstrations**
- Achieve $500K revenue within 12 months through education-driven conversion (3-5% vs industry 1-2%)
- Establish market authority as the definitive source for advanced cooling education in USA
- Build community of informed advocates who provide feedback and organic promotion
- Validate technology through credible YouTube tech channel reviews within first 3 months
- Demonstrate superiority over traditional cooling through **professional video demonstrations and FLIR thermal imaging**
- Provide instant technical answers via AI assistant to eliminate education barriers

### Background Context

The high-performance PC enthusiast market faces a critical knowledge gap in cooling technology selection. Traditional cooling solutions (air cooling, basic liquid cooling) increasingly fail to handle modern high-TDP components like I9-14900KS CPUs and RTX 4090 GPUs, yet advanced two-phase cooling remains mysterious "enterprise-only" technology. No platform exists to educate enthusiasts about thermal science principles or demonstrate advanced cooling through **comprehensive video demonstrations**.

This PRD addresses the market opportunity created by affordable two-phase cooling fluids with minimal GWP (equivalent to gasoline at 20) and zero ODP becoming available in the USA market. By creating an education-first platform featuring **professional pre-recorded demonstrations**, FLIR thermal imaging comparisons, and AI technical assistance, we transform how cooling technology is understood and adopted while building a sustainable competitive advantage through informed customer advocacy.

This approach ensures consistent, high-quality educational content that can be professionally produced to showcase the dramatic visual elements (liquid jets, "circuits getting wet," progressive thermal loads) with optimal cinematography and multiple camera angles.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

Create an immersive educational experience where visitors land directly into video demonstrations rather than traditional product marketing. The interface should feel like a high-tech laboratory or NASA mission control center, emphasizing the scientific and engineering excellence of two-phase cooling technology. Visual hierarchy guides users through progressive learning: from dramatic "circuits getting wet" introductory videos to deep technical understanding via AI assistant interactions.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Video-First Navigation**: Primary navigation through demonstration video selection and educational content discovery
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Educational content reveals complexity gradually, from basic thermal principles to advanced two-phase science
- **Conversational Learning**: AI assistant integration feels natural and immediate, not like a separate chat interface
- **Visual Data Integration**: Temperature monitoring, performance metrics seamlessly overlay video content without distraction
- **Mobile-First Responsive**: Touch-optimized controls for video interaction and AI assistant on mobile devices

### Core Screens and Views

- **Landing/Demo Hub**: Video demonstration showcase with immediate visual impact of two-phase cooling in action
- **Educational Library**: Organized thermal science content integrated with demonstration videos
- **AI Assistant Interface**: Contextual technical support overlaid or integrated with educational content
- **Comparison Gallery**: Side-by-side thermal imaging and performance comparisons with traditional cooling
- **Product Information**: Technical specifications and ordering information presented as natural progression from education
- **About Technology**: Deep-dive content explaining enterprise heritage, environmental benefits, and scientific principles

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

Ensure educational content is accessible to learners with disabilities through proper video captions, audio descriptions for visual demonstrations, keyboard navigation for all interactive elements, and screen reader compatibility for AI assistant interactions.

### Branding

Professional, scientific aesthetic emphasizing precision engineering and cutting-edge technology. Visual design should evoke high-tech laboratory environments with clean lines, technical diagrams, and sophisticated color palette. The transparent cooling case itself becomes a key visual brand element - "functional sculpture" that bridges performance and aesthetics. Avoid gaming-centric visual language in favor of professional engineering and scientific credibility.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Web-responsive design optimized for desktop viewing of detailed video demonstrations while maintaining full functionality on mobile devices. Prioritize desktop experience for complex educational content while ensuring mobile users can access core learning materials and AI assistant effectively.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

**Decision**: Monorepo structure to manage frontend, backend, AI assistant service, and content management in a single repository with shared dependencies and coordinated deployment.

**Rationale**: Educational platform requires tight coordination between video content delivery, AI assistant responses, and e-commerce functionality. Monorepo enables atomic changes across all services and simplifies development workflow for small team.

### Service Architecture

**Decision**: Serverless-first architecture with microservices pattern within monorepo structure using AWS Lambda functions for scalable, cost-effective operation.

**Components**:
