# Story 1.4: FLIR Thermal Comparison Videos

## Story

As a **tech enthusiast**,
I want **to see thermal imaging comparisons between cooling methods**,
so that **I can visually understand the temperature differences and cooling effectiveness**.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Single FLIR thermal video showing both cases side-by-side (synchronized in production)
- [x] FLIR thermal imaging video properly formatted and optimized for web delivery
- [x] Temperature scale overlays visible on thermal imaging video
- [x] Video descriptions explain what viewers are seeing in thermal comparisons
- [x] Performance metrics display showing temperature differences during stress tests
- [x] Video demonstrates progressive thermal load increases and cooling system responses
- [x] Clear visual distinction between two-phase cooling case and typical air-cooled case

## Dev Notes

**Epic**: Foundation & Video Platform Infrastructure
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days
**Dependencies**: Story 1.2 (Core Video Delivery Platform)

## Testing

- [ ] FLIR thermal imaging video quality and formatting tested
- [ ] Temperature overlays display accurately in video
- [ ] Performance metrics update in real-time during playback
- [ ] Video descriptions are clear and informative
- [ ] Progressive thermal demonstration works as expected
- [ ] Visual distinction between both cases is clear throughout video
- [ ] Video integrates properly with existing VideoPlayer component
