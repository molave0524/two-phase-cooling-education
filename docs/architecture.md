### Architectural Patterns

#### 1. Jamstack + Serverless Microservices
- **Static Generation**: Pre-rendered content for SEO and performance
- **API Routes**: Serverless functions for dynamic functionality
- **Edge Computing**: Global content delivery and processing

#### 2. Progressive Enhancement
- **Server Components**: Initial page rendering without JavaScript
- **Client Hydration**: Interactive features load progressively
- **Offline Capability**: Service worker for video caching

#### 3. Context-Aware AI Pattern
- **Session Management**: Persistent conversation context
- **Knowledge Integration**: Vector search with educational content
- **Contextual Responses**: AI adapts to user's learning progress

#### 4. Event-Driven Architecture
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time learning analytics
- **Video Events**: Engagement metrics and completion tracking
- **Commerce Events**: Cart updates and order processing

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Next.js 14 with App Router
**Rationale**: React Server Components provide optimal performance for video-heavy content while maintaining interactivity for AI chat and e-commerce features.

### 2. PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
**Rationale**: ACID compliance for e-commerce transactions, JSON support for flexible video metadata, excellent TypeScript integration.

### 3. AWS Lambda + Vercel Hosting
**Rationale**: Serverless scalability for traffic spikes during YouTube tech channel reviews, cost efficiency for variable workloads.

### 4. OpenAI GPT-4 Integration
**Rationale**: Technical accuracy for complex cooling science questions, conversation quality for educational engagement.

### 5. Stripe Payment Processing
**Rationale**: PCI DSS compliance, comprehensive features for subscription potential, trusted by target tech enthusiast audience.

## Performance Targets

### Core Web Vitals
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: < 2.5 seconds
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: < 100 milliseconds
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: < 0.1

### Application Performance
- **Page Load Time**: < 3 seconds (initial load)
- **Video Start Time**: < 2 seconds (first frame)
- **API Response Time**: < 500ms (95th percentile)
